# ATAI HW1

This repository includes work on first assigment for the subject Advanced Topics in Artificial Intelligence. For our project we needed to implement an algorithm that finds the fully connected components in a graph. The algorithm should be able to handle large graphs with a large number of nodes and edges. We also tested and evaluated the algorithm on a set of benchmark instances.

This is the work of the following students:
- Anže Mihevc 
- Miguel Figueiredo Gonçalves Marcos

More explenation about the code and the results is available in the google colab notebook available on this link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11EN9U65nfz4o1XZ6BvCGNW_7oULHJMjp?usp=sharing
