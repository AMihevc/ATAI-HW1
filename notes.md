## General idea

1. build a graph with a set amount of nodes and random connections
2. find the fully connected components. These are components that have connections that can reach every connected node. If the node has no connections it is not a fully connected graph.

## questions 

* how to generate graphs
* how to store/represent graphs for easy processing
* best way to travers the grpahs when searching for connected components? 


## Best algorithm gets 1 bonus point 

How to compare results: 
* check if inputs is correct 
* set of benchmark instances (2 sets one known and one unknown for evaluation)
